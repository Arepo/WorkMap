====================

The project has been developed following the [Agile software development method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development). This involved two [Sprint planning meetings](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_\(software_development\)), one each week, in which we went through all the possible User Stories with the Product Owner, we decided which items from the Product Backlog had the highest priority, and finally we estimated how much time was needed to translate them into shippable and tested features.
